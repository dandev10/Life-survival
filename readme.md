# Life survial!

the game is in alpha (version alpha 0.1)

a text based game where you be spawned in a
castle(COOL). in the castle you find some cool things
which you going to use later. you can leave the castle when you done. but the game ends when you just been spawned in the castle because it is in alpha 0.1 so what was you expecting.

i wrote fully in c programming language. the game uses gcc compiler where you can see in "makefile" file. changed if you have a diffrent compiler.
